Partial Tip Pickup
******************

The 96-channel pipette occupies both pipette mounts on Flex, so it's not possible to attach another pipette at the same time. Partial tip pickup lets you perform some of the same actions that you would be able to perform with a second pipette. As of version 2.16 of the API, you can configure the 96-channel pipette to pick up a single column of tips, similar to the behavior of an 8-channel pipette.

Nozzle Layout
=============

Use the :py:meth:`.configure_nozzle_layout` method to choose how many tips the 96-channel pipette will pick up. The method's ``style`` parameter accepts special layout constants. You must import these constants at the top of your protocol, or you won't be able to configure the pipette for partial tip pickup.

At minimum, import the API from the ``opentrons`` package::

    from opentrons import protocol_api

Then when you call ``configure_nozzle_layout`` later in your protocol, you can set ``style=protocol_api.COLUMN``.

For greater convenience, also import the individual layout constants that you plan to use in your protocol::

    from opentrons.protocol_api import COLUMN, ALL

Then when you call ``configure_nozzle_layout`` later in your protocol, you can set ``style=COLUMN``.

Here is the start of a protocol that performs both imports, loads a 96-channel pipette, and sets it to pick up a single column of tips.

.. code-block:: python
    :substitutions:

    from opentrons import protocol_api
    from opentrons.protocol_api import COLUMN, ALL

    requirements = {"robotType": "Flex", "apiLevel": "|apiLevel|"}

    def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext):
        column_rack = protocol.load_labware(
            load_name="opentrons_flex_96_tiprack_1000ul",
            location="D3"
        )
        trash = protocol.load_trash_bin("A3")
        pipette = protocol.load_instrument("flex_96channel_1000")
        pipette.configure_nozzle_layout(
            style=COLUMN,
            start="A12",
            tip_racks=[column_rack]
        )

.. versionadded:: 2.16

Let's unpack some of the details of this code.

First, we've given a special name to the tip rack, ``column_rack``. You can name your tip racks whatever you like, but if you're performing full pickup and partial pickup in the same protocol, you'll need to keep them separate. See :ref:`partial-tip-rack-adapters` below.

Next, we load the 96-channel pipette. Note that :py:meth:`.load_instrument` only has a single argument. The 96-channel pipette occupies both mounts, so ``mount`` is omissible. The ``tip_racks`` argument is always optional. But it would have no effect to declare it here, because every call to ``configure_nozzle_layout()`` resets the pipette's :py:obj:`.InstrumentContext.tip_racks` property.

Finally, we configure the nozzle layout, with three arguments.

    - The ``style`` parameter directly accepts the ``COLUMN`` constant, since we imported it at the top of the protocol.
    - The ``start`` parameter accepts a nozzle name, representing the back-left nozzle in the layout, as a string. ``"A12"`` tells the pipette to use its rightmost column of nozzles for pipetting.
    - The ``tip_racks`` parameter tells the pipette which racks to use for tip tracking, just like :ref:`adding tip racks <pipette-tip-racks>` when loading a pipette.

In this configuration, pipetting actions will use a single column::

    # configured in COLUMN mode
    pipette.pick_up_tip()  # picks up A1-H1 from tip rack
    pipette.drop_tip()
    pipette.pick_up_tip()  # picks up A2-H2 from tip rack

.. warning::

    :py:meth:`.InstrumentContext.pick_up_tip` always accepts a ``location`` argument, regardless of nozzle configuration. Do not pass a value that would lead the pipette to line up over more unused tips than specified by the current layout. For example, setting ``COLUMN`` layout and then calling ``pipette.pick_up_tip(tip_rack["A2"])`` on a full tip rack will lead to unexpected pipetting behavior and potential crashes.

.. _partial-tip-rack-adapters:

Tip Rack Adapters
=================

You can use both partial and full tip pickup in the same protocol. This requires having some tip racks directly on the deck, and some tip racks in the tip rack adapter.

Do not use a tip rack adapter when performing partial tip pickup. Instead, place the tip rack on the deck. During partial tip pickup, the 96-channel pipette lowers onto the tip rack in a horizontally offset position. If the tip rack were in its adapter, the pipette would collide with the adapter's posts, which protrude above the top of the tip rack. If you configure the pipette for partial pickup and then call ``pick_up_tip()`` on a tip rack that's loaded onto an adapter, the API will raise an error.

On the other hand, you must use the tip rack adapter for full tip pickup. If the 96-channel pipette is in a full layout, either by default or by configuring ``style=ALL``, and you then call ``pick_up_tip()`` on a tip rack that's not in an adapter, the API will raise an error.

When switching between full and partial pickup, you may want to organize your tip racks into lists, depending on whether they're loaded on adapters or not.

.. code-block:: python

    tips_1 = protocol.load_labware(
        "opentrons_flex_96_tiprack_1000ul", "C1"
    )
    tips_2 = protocol.load_labware(
        "opentrons_flex_96_tiprack_1000ul", "D1"
    )
    tips_3 = protocol.load_labware(
        "opentrons_flex_96_tiprack_1000ul", "C3",
        adapter="opentrons_flex_96_tiprack_adapter"
    )
    tips_4 = protocol.load_labware(
        "opentrons_flex_96_tiprack_1000ul", "D3",
        adapter="opentrons_flex_96_tiprack_adapter"
    )

    partial_tip_racks = [tips_1, tips_2]
    full_tip_racks = [tips_3, tips_4]

.. Tip::

    It's also good practice to keep separate lists of tip racks when using multiple partial tip pickup configurations (i.e., using both column 1 and column 12 in the same protocol). This improves positional accuracy when picking up tips. Additionally, use Labware Position Check in the Opentrons App to ensure that the partial configuration is well-aligned to the rack.

Now, when you configure the nozzle layout, you can reference the appropriate list as the value of ``tip_racks``::

    pipette.configure_nozzle_layout(
        style=COLUMN,
        start="A12",
        tip_racks=partial_tip_racks
    )
    # partial pipetting commands go here

    pipette.configure_nozzle_layout(
        style=ALL,
        tip_racks=full_tip_racks
    )
    pipette.pick_up_tip()  # picks up full rack in C1

This keeps tip tracking consistent across each type of pickup. And it reduces the risk of errors due to the incorrect presence or absence of a tip rack adapter.


Tip Pickup and Conflicts
========================

During partial tip pickup, 96-channel pipette moves into spaces above adjacent slots. To avoid crashes, the API prevents you from performing partial tip pickup when there is tall labware in these spaces. The current nozzle layout determines which labware can safely occupy adjacent slots.

The API will raise errors for potential labware crashes when using a column nozzle configuration. Nevertheless, it's a good idea to do the following when working with partial tip pickup:

    - Plan your deck layout carefully. Make a diagram and visualize everywhere the pipette will travel.
    - Simulate your protocol and compare the run preview to your expectations of where the pipette will travel.
    - Perform a dry run with only tip racks on the deck. Have the Emergency Stop Pendant handy in case you see an impending crash.

For column pickup, Opentrons recommends using the nozzles in column 12 of the pipette::

    pipette.configure_nozzle_layout(
        style=COLUMN,
        start="A12",
    )

When using column 12, the pipette overhangs space to the left of wherever it is picking up tips or pipetting. For this reason, it's a good idea to organize tip racks front to back on the deck. If you place them side by side, the rack to the right will be inaccessible. For example, let's load three tip racks in the front left corner of the deck::

    tips_C1 = protocol.load_labware("opentrons_flex_96_tiprack_1000ul", "C1")
    tips_D1 = protocol.load_labware("opentrons_flex_96_tiprack_1000ul", "D1")
    tips_D2 = protocol.load_labware("opentrons_flex_96_tiprack_1000ul", "D2")

Now the pipette will be able to access the racks in column 1 only. ``pick_up_tip(tips_D2["A1"])`` will raise an error due to the tip rack immediately to its left, in slot D1. There a couple of ways to avoid this error:

    - Load the tip rack in a different slot, with no tall labware to its left.
    - Use all the tips in slot D1 first, and then use :py:meth:`.move_labware` to make space for the pipette before picking up tips from D2.

You would get a similar error trying to aspirate from or dispense into a well plate in slot D3, since there is a tip rack to the left.

.. tip::

    When using column 12 for partial tip pickup and pipetting, generally organize your deck with the shortest labware on the left side of the deck, and the tallest labware on the right side.

If your application can't accommodate a deck layout that works well with column 12, you can configure the 96-channel pipette to pick up tips with column 1::

    pipette.configure_nozzle_layout(
        style=COLUMN,
        start="A1",
    )

.. note::

    When using a column 1 layout, the pipette can't reach the rightmost portion of labware in slots A3â€“D3. Any well that is within 29 mm of the right edge of the slot may be inaccessible. Use a column 12 layout if you need to pipette in that area.
