from hardware_testing.drivers.radwag import RadwagScale

# find port using known VID:PID, then connect
vid, pid = RadwagScale.vid_pid()
scale = RadwagScale.create(port=find_port(vid=vid, pid=pid))
scale.connect()
# read grams and stability marker
grams, is_stable = scale.read_mass()
print(f"Scale reading: grams={grams}, is_stable={is_stable}")
# disconnect from serial port
scale.disconnect()
```
