# Overview

This directory has examples of what a real robot might have in its `robot-server` persistence directory. (See the environment variable `OT_ROBOT_SERVER_persistence_directory` for background.)

These help with testing schema migration and backwards compatibility.

## Snapshot notes

### v6.0.1

This snapshot comes from a v6.0.1 dev server (run with `make -C robot-server dev`).

It includes these protocols, which were uploaded by manually issuing HTTP `POST` requests:

- [simpleV6.json](https://github.com/Opentrons/opentrons/blob/4f9c72ab076692a377afc7245e857385935763a8/shared-data/protocol/fixtures/6/simpleV6.json)
- [multipleTipracksWithTC.json](https://github.com/Opentrons/opentrons/blob/4f9c72ab076692a377afc7245e857385935763a8/shared-data/protocol/fixtures/6/multipleTipracksWithTC.json)
- [tempAndMagModuleCommands.json](https://github.com/Opentrons/opentrons/blob/4f9c72ab076692a377afc7245e857385935763a8/shared-data/protocol/fixtures/6/tempAndMagModuleCommands.json)
- [swift_smoke.py](https://github.com/Opentrons/opentrons/blob/4f9c72ab076692a377afc7245e857385935763a8/g-code-testing/g_code_test_data/protocol/protocols/slow/swift_smoke.py)

The JSON protocols were chosen to cover a wide breadth of Protocol Engine commands.

Each protocol has one completed analysis and one successful run. multipleTipracksWithTC.json also has one failed run from a mismatched pipette error.

### v6.1.0

This snapshot comes from v6.1.0 on a real non-refresh robot. The robot was restarted following the successful execution of both protocols.

The 2 protocols are to provide basic coverage of a python and json protocol. Each protocol has 1 successful analysis and run.

### v6.2.0

This snapshot comes from v6.2.0 on a real non-refresh robot. The robot was restarted following the successful execution of both protocols.

The 2 protocols are to provide basic coverage of a python and json protocol. Each protocol has 1 successful analysis and run.

**NOTE** This db will cause a downgrade migration issue if loaded on a robot with 6.1

### corrupt

Contains an invalid SQLite database file, to simulate a database that's been corrupted.

   1. Complex python v2 protocol analysis
1. Proceed to run but cancel before run
   1. Complex JSON v5 protocol analysis
1. Power off robot and power on
1. Retrieve robot DB

### ot3_v0.14.0_python_validation

This has a single Python protocol and a single run of that protocol. The protocol file is valid on the Flex's internal release v0.14.0, but invalid for the first public release (v7.0.0), because of additional validation of the `metadata` and `requirements` dicts that was added late during Flex development. See https://opentrons.atlassian.net/browse/RSS-306.

### v7.1.1

An amalgamation of the office's ABR (Application Based Reliability) robots, which were running the v7.1.1 stable release. A few runs were extracted from each robot and manually combined to form a single Frankenstein persistence directory.
