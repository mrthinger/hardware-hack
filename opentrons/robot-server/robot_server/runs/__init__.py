"""Run creation and management.

A "run" is a logical container for a user's interaction with a robot,
usually (but not always) with a well-defined start point and end point.
Examples of "runs" include:

- A run to execute a specific protocol
- A run to complete a specific calibration procedure
- A long running, "default" run to perform one-off actions, like toggling
  the frame lights on
