    This ties the pretty hostname and the Avahi service name together,
    so they always have the same value.

    The `set_name()` and `get_name()` methods are intended for use by HTTP
    endpoints, which makes for a total of three names tied together,
    if you also count the name available over HTTP.

    See the `name_management` package docstring for an overview of these various names.

    We tie all of these names together because:

    * It's important to avoid confusing the client-side discovery client,
      at least at the time of writing.
      https://github.com/Opentrons/opentrons/issues/10199

    * It helps maintain a conceptually simple interface.
      There is one name accessible in three separate ways,
      rather than three separate names.

    * It implements the DNS-SD spec's recommendation to make the DNS-SD instance name
      configurable. https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6763#section-4.1.1
