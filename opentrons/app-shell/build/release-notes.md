## Opentrons App Changes in 7.3.0

Welcome to the v7.3.0 release of the Opentrons App! This release adds support for Python protocols with runtime parameters, letting you change the behavior of a protocol each time you run it.

Note: After updating, the app will prompt you to reanalyze all previously imported protocols. This is a one-time step and should not affect protocol behavior.

### New Features

Runtime Parameters

- Available runtime parameters are shown on the protocol details screen.
- Both the Opentrons App and touchscreen let you enter new parameter values during run setup.
- The app highlights changed parameter values so you can confirm them before starting the run.
- The run preview (before the run) and run log (after the run) reflect changes to steps based on your chosen parameter values.

Modules in Deck Configuration

- You can now specify what slots modules occupy on Flex in deck configuration.
- When moving, Flex will avoid modules specified in deck configuration but not loaded in the protocol.
- Deck configuration must be compatible with the protocol's requirements before you start a run.

### Improved Features

- Lists of robots are now sorted alphabetically.

### Removals

- Removed the "Use older protocol analysis method" advanced setting for OT-2. If you need this type of analysis, use `opentrons_simulate` on the command line.

### Bug Fixes

- All run log steps now appear in the same font size.
- The app now properly sends custom labware definitions, along with the corresponding Python protocol, to Flex robots connected via USB.

### Known Issues

- Previously saved labware offset data may not be available when setting up a run via a USB connection from a Windows computer. Re-run Labware Position Check or use a Wi-Fi connection instead.
- If you apply labware offset data for a particular type of labware, and then load a different type of labware in its place via a runtime parameter, the new labware type will have default offsets (0.0 on all axes). Re-run Labware Position Check to set offsets for the new labware.

## Opentrons App Changes in 7.2.2

Welcome to the v7.2.2 release of the Opentrons App!

There are no changes to the Opentrons App in v7.2.2, but it is required for updating the robot software to improve some features.

---

## Opentrons App Changes in 7.2.1

Welcome to the v7.2.1 release of the Opentrons App!

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a memory leak that could cause the app to crash.

---

## Opentrons App Changes in 7.2.0

Welcome to the v7.2.0 release of the Opentrons App!

The Linux version of the Opentrons App now requires Ubuntu 20.04 or newer.

### New Features

- Added a warning in case you need to manually remove tips from a pipette after power cycling the robot.

### Improved Features

- Commands involving the trash bin or waste chute now appear in the run preview.
- The app will prompt you to reanalyze protocols that haven't been analyzed in such a long time that intervening changes to the app could affect their behavior.

### Bug Fixes

- The OT-2 now consistently applies tip length calibration. There used to be a height discrepancy between Labware Position Check and protocol runs. If you previously compensated for the inconsistent pipette height with labware offsets, re-run Labware Position Check to avoid pipette crashes.
- The OT-2 now accurately calculates the position of the Thermocycler. If you previously compensated for the incorrect position with labware offsets, re-run Labware Position Check to avoid pipette crashes.

### Known Issues

- It's possible to start conflicting instrument detachment workflows when controlling one robot from multiple computers. Verify that the robot is idle before starting instrument detachment.
- Robots may fail to reconnect after renaming them over a USB connection on Windows.

## Opentrons App Changes in 7.1.0

Welcome to the v7.1.0 release of the Opentrons App! This release includes new deck and pipette functionality for Opentrons Flex, a new workflow for dropping tips after a protocol is canceled, and other improvements.

### New Features

- Specify the deck configuration of Flex, including the movable trash bin, waste chute, and staging area slots.
- Resolve conflicts between the hardware a protocol requires and the current deck configuration as part of run setup.
- Run protocols that use the Flex 96-Channel Pipette, including partial tip pickup.
- Choose where to dispense liquid and drop tips held by a pipette when a protocol is canceled.

### Improved Features

- Labware Position Check on Flex uses the pipette calibration probe, instead of a tip, for greater accuracy.

### Bug Fixes

- Labware Position Check no longer tries to check the same labware in the same position twice, which was leading to errors.

---

## Opentrons App Changes in 7.0.2

Welcome to the v7.0.2 release of the Opentrons App!

---

## Opentrons App Changes in 7.0.1

Welcome to the v7.0.1 release of the Opentrons App! This release builds on the major release that added support for Opentrons Flex.

### Improved Features

- Pipettes move higher during Labware Position Check to avoid crashes in all deck slots, not just those with labware loaded in the protocol.

### Bug Fixes

- The app no longer blocks running valid protocols due to "not valid JSON" or "apiLevel not declared" errors.
- Robot commands, like turning the lights on or off, no longer take a long time to execute.

## Opentrons App Changes in 6.0.1

Welcome to the v6.0.1 release of the Opentrons App! This release focuses on a visual redesign of the app that offers more ways to manage protocols even when you're not connected to a robot.

This release also includes updates to the robot operating system, so be sure to update any OT-2s before running protocols with this version of the app.

### New Features

Updated design: A more polished and modern design, built around the new, always-accessible Protocols, Labware, and Devices sections.

Protocols section

- Import multiple protocols and manage them all in one place.
- In-app protocol analysis lets you import Python and JSON protocol files without connecting to a robot.
- View deck setup, required hardware, and protocol metadata â before, during, or after a run.

Labware section

- Browse labware definitions from the Opentrons Labware Library right in the app.
- Import custom labware and manage it alongside standard labware.

Devices section

- New view for currently available and recently connected robots.
- See recently run protocols on a robot, including those run from other computers.
- Run a protocol directly from the robot details page.
- Easily change a robot's name from the new robot settings page.

### 6.0.0 to 6.0.1

## Opentrons App Changes in 5.0.2

Welcome to the v5.0.2 release of the Opentrons App!

The 5.0.2 release reshapes the way you upload and set up protocols to run on your OT-2. Read below to find out about the new features in 5.0.0.

### New Features

- A completely revamped protocol upload experience that will walk you through setting up your OT-2 for the run
- A new way to check the positioning of your labware prior to a run, where you can apply offsets to each labware individually
- More visibility into the progress of protocol execution on the robot
- Quick and easy re-running of your last used protocol

### 5.0.1 to 5.0.2

The 5.0.2 hotfix release fixes three issues:

1. If you use `load_labware_from_definition` in your Python protocol, you are now able to use Labware Position Check.
2. User-defined labware labels, if present, are now displayed in "Labware Setup"
3. Certain types of protocol upload failures will now show an error message instead of silently failing.

### 5.0.0 to 5.0.1

- Protocol upload should be much faster

---

## Opentrons App Changes in 4.0.0

Opentrons App 4.0.0 is a major software release, bringing an entirely overhauled robot calibration process for the OT-2; a full switch to Opentrons Protocol API Version 2; and many look and feel improvements.

**After you install this update, you must calibrate your OT-2's pipette offsets and tip lengths before running a protocol**. This will take approximately fifteen minutes, but you will not be able to run a protocol until your OT-2 is calibrated.

### OT-2 Calibration Changes

In Opentrons App and Robot Software 4.0.0, the calibration process for the OT-2 is different and improved from major version 3. With these changes, you'll calibrate less often; the calibration processes are shorter, easier, and more reliable; and you can finally use different kinds of tips on the same pipette in the same protocol accurately.

For more in-depth information on the changes, [click here](https://support.opentrons.com/en/articles/3499692-how-calibration-works-on-the-ot-2).

### Full Use of Python Protocol API Version 2

We released Python Protocol API Version 2 almost a year ago, and have been continuously improving it since, with 8 new intermediate API levels, each containing bugfixes, improvements, or support for new hardware. It's ready to be the only way Python protocols are written for the OT-2. Accordingly, in 4.0.0 and subsequent releases, **the OT-2 will not accept Python Protocol API Version 1 protocols**.

### Look and Feel Changes

In 4.0.0, the Opentrons App has some major changes to the Robots tab and the Pipettes & Modules page. These changes present information about the new calibration data more concisely in a better-organized way. We hope you like it!
