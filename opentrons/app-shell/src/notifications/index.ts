// All associated IPs reference the active connection. Subscriptions are handled "lazily" - a component must
// dispatch a subscribe action before a subscription request is made to the broker. Unsubscribe requests only occur if
// the broker sends an "unsubscribe" flag. Pending subs and unsubs are used to prevent unnecessary network and broker load.
