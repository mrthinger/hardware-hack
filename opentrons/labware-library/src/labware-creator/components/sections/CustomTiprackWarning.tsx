                Opentrons tip racks are recommended for use with the OT-2 and
                Flex because they are specifically designed and verified for
                automation.

                Third party tips can fit, but not necessarily with a tight seal.
                You risk tips falling off mid-run as well as pipetting
                inaccuracy. They may also be more likely to bend or break.
