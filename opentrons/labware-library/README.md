### labware-library tasks

This directory's Makefile has the following set of labware-library specific development tasks defined.

```shell
# default task: build production artifacts
# these three commands are identical
make -C labware-library
make -C labware-library all
make -C labware-library clean dist

# start a hot-reloading development server
# (optional) specify port with PORT; default is 8080
make -C labware-library dev
make -C labware-library dev PORT=8081

# build production assets and serve them
# (optional) specify port with PORT; default is 9090

```

### webpack setup

This project (along with our other front-end projects) uses [webpack][] to generate artifacts.

- Extends our [base webpack config][base-config]
- Entry point is [`labware-library/src/index.tsx`][entry]
- [Handlebars][] HTML template is [`labware-library/src/index.hbs`][template]
  - Post-build, the site is crawled and prerendered with [react-snap][]
- Global CSS is [`labware-library/src/global.module.css`][global-style]
  - All other CSS is used via [CSS Modules][]
- All artifacts will be output to `labware-library/dist`
